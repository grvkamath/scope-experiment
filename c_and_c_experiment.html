        <strong>We're conducting an experiment to see whether language AI systems produce natural-sounding continuations to certain kinds of phrases and sentences.</strong>
        In order to make such a judgment we need to first establish a baseline of what are and aren't natural-sounding continuations, using human assessments. 
        This is where you, the experiment-taker, come in.
        You will read some sentences, along with possible continuations. <strong>Your task is to give your opinion on how natural-sounding
          each continuation is.</strong><br>
        <br>
        The experiment will take approximately 15 minutes. Read and agree to the consent form below, and we'll begin with two examples.

      <br>
      <p class="center"> <strong>CONSENT FORM</strong></p>
      <p class="left" style="font-size:16px; color: darkslateblue;">
        You are invited to participate in a research study looking at the cases of language that do and don't sound natural.<strong>
          Please read this form carefully and ask any questions you may have before agreeing to take part in the study. 
        </strong> 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Investigators: </strong>Dr. Siva Reddy (Assistant Professor of Linguistics and Computer Science at McGill University) 
        and Dr. Michael Wagner (Professor of Linguistics at  McGill University), 
        and students and research assistants under the two professors.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>What this study is about: </strong>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether language AI systems are able to 
        capture certain semantic structures present in natural language that humans are able to work with. 
        This is investigated in terms of the types of continuations that language AI systems produce to certain types of phrases, 
        and how these compare to human judgments of these continuations.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>What we will ask you to do: </strong>In this study you read sentences and continuations, and answer questions about them. 
        We will also ask to collect some general information about your age, gender, level of education, and language to be able to better interpret the data, 
        <strong>but this part is wholly optional</strong>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Risks and benefits: </strong>This experiment involves no known risks or discomfort to you beyond the risks of everyday life, nor is it expected to be of any direct benefit to you.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Compensation: </strong>You will be compensated according to the amount specified on the Prolific page. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Use of your data: </strong>The data collected in this study will be stored on a secure server and on a cloud-storage service (either Google Drive or Dropbox). 
        Your Prolific ID will not be directly linked to your data but will be stored separately (we only store the session ID). We will delete the separately stored Prolific ID from our files within 1 year at the latest.
        <br>
        The data we collect may also be used to illustrate the results of the research results in an online interactive site. 
        The anonymized data may also be published as part of an anonymous corpus distributed for further research. By consenting to releasing your data as a corpus, you will help ensure that your contribution will have a more lasting impact.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Taking part is voluntary: </strong>Your participation is completely voluntary. You are free to withdraw consent and discontinue participation in the project at any time without penalty. 
        However, data cannot be withdrawn after the information linking your Prolific ID to your data has been deleted. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>If you have any questions: </strong>You can contact Gaurav Kamath (email: gaurav.kamath@mail.mcgill.ca), graduate student under Dr. Siva Reddy, with any questions about this study. When communicating by email,
